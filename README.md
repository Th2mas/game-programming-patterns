# Game Programming Patterns
This project follows Robert Nystrom's [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) and gives you
the patterns + examples in a modern TDD approach using C++20 (most of it is still C++11 though).

## Acknowledgements
Big thanks to Robert Nystrom for giving us such a great reference for programming patterns! 
This was my first programming patterns book and encouraged me to improve my C++ skills.
